# Data Warehouse Project

This repository contains a **Data Warehouse project** built as part of my journey into **data engineering**.

The goal of this project is to practice and strengthen my **SQL skills** while learning core data warehousing concepts such as:
- Data modeling
- ETL / ELT processes
- Fact and dimension tables
- Querying analytical data

This project was created by following a tutorial by **Data with Baraa**, with a focus on understanding each step rather than simply copying code.

## Technologies Used
- SQL
- Relational Database (PostgreSQL)

## Purpose
This is a **learning-focused project** intended to demonstrate my growing understanding of data engineering fundamentals.

## 🌟 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Nabeel Rizvi**, and I’m currently beginning my journey into **data engineering**.

I’ve always had an interest in coding and working with data, and after exploring different tech roles, I became particularly interested in data engineering. This project is my **first hands-on project**, created to help me learn and practice SQL and core data warehousing concepts.

I’m focused on learning through building projects and gradually developing my skills as I work toward a career in data engineering.
